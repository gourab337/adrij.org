                <big><li>Our solar system is made up of a star, eight planets, and countless smaller bodies such as dwarf planets, asteroids, and comets.</li></big><p/>
                <big><li>Our solar system orbits the center of the Milky Way galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph). We‚Äôre in one of the galaxy‚Äôs four spiral arms.</li></big><p/>
                <big><li>It takes our solar system about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center.</li></big><p/>
                <big><li>Our solar system is a region of space. It has no atmosphere. But it contains many worlds ‚Äì including Earth ‚Äì with many kinds of atmospheres.</li></big><p/>
                <big><li>The planets of our solar system ‚Äì and even some asteroids ‚Äì hold more than 200 moons in their orbits.</li></big><p/>
                <big><li>The four giant planets ‚Äì and at least one asteroid ‚Äì have rings. None are as spectacular as Saturn‚Äôs gorgeous rings.</li></big><p/>
                <big><li>More than 300 robotic spacecraft have explored destinations beyond Earth's orbit, including 24 American astronauts who made the trip from the Earth to the Moon.</li></big><p/>
                <big><li>Our solar system is the only one known to support life. So far, we only know of life on Earth, but we‚Äôre looking for more everywhere we can.</li></big><p/>
                <big><li>NASA‚Äôs Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are the only spacecraft to leave our solar system. Three other spacecraft ‚Äì Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, and New Horizons ‚Äì will eventually hit interstellar space.</li></big><p/>

                <big><h2><u>Facts about the Sun</u></h2></big>
                <ol type="1">
                    <big><li>The Sun is about 100 times wider than Earth and about 10 times wider than Jupiter, the biggest planet. If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be about the size of a nickel.</li></big><p/>
                    <big><li>The Sun is the only star in our solar system. It is the center of our solar system, and its gravity holds the solar system together. Everything in our solar system revolves around it ‚Äì the planets, asteroids, comets, and tiny bits of space debris.</li></big><p/>
                    <big><li>Measuring a ‚Äúday‚Äù on the Sun is complicated because of the way it rotates. It doesn't spin as a single, solid ball. This is because the Sun‚Äôs surface isn't solid like Earth's. Instead, the Sun is made of super-hot, electrically charged gas called plasma. This plasma rotates at different speeds on different parts of the Sun. At its equator, the Sun completes one rotation in 25 Earth days. At its poles, the Sun rotates once on its axis every 36 Earth days.</li></big><p/>
                    <big><li>The part of the Sun we see from Earth ‚Äì the part we call the surface ‚Äì is the photosphere. The Sun doesn't actually have a solid surface because it‚Äôs a ball of plasma.</li></big><p/>
                    <big><li>Above the Sun‚Äôs surface are its thin chromosphere and the huge corona (crown). This is where we see features such as solar prominences, flares, and coronal mass ejections. The latter two are giant explosions of energy and particles that can reach Earth.</li></big><p/>
                    <big><li>The Sun doesn't have moons, but it‚Äôs orbited by eight planets, at least five dwarf planets, tens of thousands of asteroids, and perhaps three trillion comets and icy bodies.</li></big><p/>
                    <big><li>Several spacecraft are currently investigating the Sun including Parker Solar Probe, STEREO, Solar Orbiter, SOHO, Solar Dynamics Observatory, Hinode, IRIS, and Wind.</li></big><p/>
                    <big><li>The Sun would have been surrounded by a disk of gas and dust early in its history when the solar system was first forming 4.6 billion years ago. Some of that dust is still around today, in several dust rings that circle the Sun. They trace the orbits of planets, whose gravity tugs dust into place around the Sun.</li></big><p/>
                    <big><li>Nothing could live on the Sun, but its energy is vital for most life on Earth.</li></big><p/>
                    <big><li>The temperature in the Sun's core is about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius) ‚Äì hot enough to sustain nuclear fusion. This creates outward pressure that supports the star's gigantic mass, keeping it from collapsing.</li></big><p/>
